# InStock

## Description

InStock is a collaborative React application developed with three other talented developers. We utilized a Jira board within an agile framework to guide the project, focusing on best practices and methodologies. The app connects to an Express backend via a RESTful API, enabling dynamic data retrieval and management.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages
- **CSS/SCSS**: Styling the application with modern CSS techniques
- **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React.js
